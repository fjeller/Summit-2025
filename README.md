# Summit-2025

Sample Application for the Banking Summit 2025

## Important Information

To run the application you need an SQL Server. The connectionstrings need to be adapted to your system.
if your system is set up with SQL Server as the default instance (not named) and with integrated security enabled,
everything should almost work out of the box (you'll just need to create the database itself).

The script to set up the database (including all the tables) can be found in the folder `__Database-Scripts`.

Happy Coding.
